<blockquote>
<p>The following Poems bear somewhat a vague title, because
such only would describe the nature of Poems which have been
derived in very different degrees from the sources thus indicated.
Some are mere translations; others have been modelled anew,
and only such portions used of the originals as were adapted to
my purpose: of others it is only the imagery and thought which
are Eastern, and these have been put together in new combinations;
while of others it is the story, and nothing more, which has been
borrowed, it may be from some prose source. On this subject,
however, more information will be given in the Notes.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">On a fair ship, borne swiftly o’er the deep,</div>
<div class="i0">A man was lying, wrapt in dreamless sleep;</div>
<div class="i0">When unawares upon a sunken rock</div>
<div class="i0">That vessel struck, and shattered with the shock.</div>
<div class="i0">But strange! the plank where lay the sleeper bore</div>
<div class="i0">Him wrapt in deep sleep ever, to the shore:</div>
<div class="i0">It bore him safely through the foam and spray,</div>
<div class="i0">High up on land, where couched ’mid flowers he lay.</div>
<div class="i0">Sweet tones first woke him from his sleep, when round</div>
<div class="i0">His couch observant multitudes he found:</div>
<div class="i0">All hailed him then, and did before him bow,</div>
<div class="i0">And with one voice exclaimed,—“Our King art thou.”</div>
<div class="i0">With jubilant applause they bore him on,</div>
<div class="i0">And set him wondering on a royal throne:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
<div class="i0">And some his limbs with royal robes arrayed,</div>
<div class="i0">And some before him duteous homage paid,</div>
<div class="i0">And some brought gifts, all rare and costly things,</div>
<div class="i0">Nature’s and Art’s profusest offerings.</div>
<div class="i0">Around him counsellors and servants prest,</div>
<div class="i0">All eager to accomplish his behest.</div>
<div class="i0">Wish unaccomplished of his soul was none;</div>
<div class="i0">The thing that he commanded, it was done.</div>

<div class="i0">Alone in hall magnificent he sate,</div>
<div class="i0">And mused upon the wonder of his fate,</div>
<div class="i0">When lo! an aged counsellor, a seer</div>
<div class="i0">Before unnoticed, to the King drew near,</div>

<div class="i0">A time is fixed, albeit unknown to thee,</div>
<div class="i0">Which when it comes, thou banished hence shalt be.</div>
<div class="i0">Round this fair isle, though hidden from the eye</div>
<div class="i0">By mist and vapour, many islands lie:</div>
<div class="i0">Bare are their coasts, and dreary and forlorn,</div>
<div class="i0">And unto them the banished kings are borne;</div>

<div class="i0">But make thou there provision of delight,</div>

<div class="i0">So when the world, which speaks thee now so fair,</div>
<div class="i0">And flatters so, again shall strip thee bare,</div>
<div class="i0">And sends thee naked forth in harshest wise,</div>
<div class="i0">Thou joyfully wilt seek thy Paradise.</div>
<div class="i0"><i>There</i> will not vex thee memories of the past,</div>
<div class="i0">While hope will heighten here the joys thou hast.</div>
<div class="i0">This do, while yet the power is in thine hand,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Then raised the Prince his head with courage new,</div>
<div class="i0">And what the sage advised, prepared to do.</div>
<div class="i0">He ruled his realm with meekness, and meanwhile</div>
<div class="i0">He marvellously decked the chosen isle;</div>
<div class="i0">Bade there his servants build up royal towers,</div>
<div class="i0">And change its barren sands to leafy bowers;</div>
<div class="i0">Bade fountains there be hewn, and caused to bloom</div>
<div class="i0">Immortal amaranths, shedding rich perfume.</div>
<div class="i0">And when he long enough had kept his throne,</div>
<div class="i0">To him sweet odours from that isle were blown:</div>
<div class="i0">Then knew he that its gardens blooming were,</div>
<div class="i0">And all the yearnings of his soul were there.</div>
<div class="i0">Grief was it not to him, but joy, when they</div>
<div class="i0">His crown and sceptre bade him quit one day;</div>
<div class="i0">When him his servants rudely did dismiss,</div>
<div class="i0">’Twas not the sentence of his ended bliss,</div>
<div class="i0">But pomp and power he cheerfully forsook,</div>
<div class="i0">And to his isle a willing journey took,</div>
<div class="i0">And found diviner pleasure on that shore,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">When Moses once on Horeb’s rocky steep,</div>
<div class="i0">A banished man, was keeping Jethro’s sheep,</div>
<div class="i0">What time his flocks along the hills and dells</div>
<div class="i0">Made music with their bleatings and their bells,</div>
<div class="i0">He by the thoughts that stirred within him, drawn</div>
<div class="i0">Deep in the mountain, heard at early dawn</div>
<div class="i0">One who in prayer did all his soul outpour,</div>
<div class="i0">With deep heart-earnestness, but nothing more.</div>
<div class="i0">For strange his words were, savage and uncouth,</div>
<div class="i0">And little did he know in very sooth</div>
<div class="i0">Of that great Lord, to whom his vows were made.</div>
<div class="i0">The other for a moment listening staid,</div>
<div class="i0">Until, his patience altogether spent—</div>

<div class="i0">But were enough to make God’s blessings cease.”</div>
<div class="i0">Rebuked, the simple herdsman held his peace,</div>
<div class="i0">And only crying—“Thou hast rent my heart,”</div>
<div class="i0">He fled into the desert far apart:</div>
<div class="i0">While with himself, and with his zeal content,</div>
<div class="i0">His steps the Son of Amram homeward bent,</div>
<div class="i0">And ever to himself applauses lent—</div>
<div class="i0">Much wondering that he did not find the same</div>

<div class="i0">All bosoms filled with horror or with ruth,</div>
<div class="i0">In the same city dwelt a Monk as well,</div>
<div class="i0">Round whom all crowded when he left his cell.</div>
<div class="i0">Great name for prayer and penance he had gained,</div>
<div class="i0">And he one day that Prophet entertained:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
<div class="i0">When in their sight this sinner did appear,</div>
<div class="i0">Who yet for awe presumed not to draw near,</div>
<div class="i0">But falling back, like moth from stunning light,</div>
<div class="i0">Lay on the ground, as blinded by their sight.</div>
<div class="i0">And as in spring relents the frozen ground,</div>
<div class="i0">Even so it seemed as though his heart unbound,</div>
<div class="i0">Streamed from his eyes like loosened floods the tears:</div>
<div class="i0">“Woe’s me,” he cried; “for thirty guilty years—</div>
<div class="i0">My life’s best treasure have I spent in vain,</div>
<div class="i0">And death and hell are now my only gain.</div>
<div class="i0">I totter on a dark chasm’s dreadful brink,</div>
<div class="i0">Hell’s jaws are yawning for me, and I sink:</div>
<div class="i0">Yet since none ever thou didst from thee cast,</div>
<div class="i0">I stretch my hands to thee; Lord, hold them fast.”</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">But here the Monk with lifted eyebrows—“Peace,</div>
<div class="i0">Blasphemer,—from thy useless clamors cease:</div>
<div class="i0">And darest thou, thus steeped in sin, make free</div>
<div class="i0">With him, God’s holy Prophet, and with me?</div>

<div class="i0">Stand far from this man on the judgment day.”—</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
<div class="i0">More he had said, but on the Prophet broke</div>
<div class="i0">Swift inspiration, and he straightway spoke:</div>
<div class="i0">“Two here have prayed—diverse has been their prayer,</div>
<div class="i0">Yet granted both their supplications are.</div>
<div class="i0">He who in mire of sin now thirty years</div>
<div class="i0">Has rolled, forgiveness asks with many tears:</div>
<div class="i0">Ne’er yet his head has contrite sinner lain</div>
<div class="i0">Upon the threshold of God’s throne in vain.</div>
<div class="i0">All he has sinned to him shall be forgiven,</div>
<div class="i0">Whom God has chose a denizen of heaven.</div>
<div class="i0">That monk has prayed upon the other hand</div>
<div class="i0">That he may never near this sinner stand;</div>
<div class="i0">That this may be so, hell his place must be,</div>
<div class="i0">Where never more this sinner he shall see.</div>
<div class="i0">Whose robe is white, but heart is black with pride,</div>
<div class="i0">He for himself hell’s gate has opened wide,</div>
<div class="i0">For weighed in God the All-sufficient’s scale,</div>
<div class="i0">Not claims nor righteousness of man avail;</div>
<div class="i0">But these are costly in his sight indeed,—</div>
<div class="i0">Repentance, poverty, and sense of need.”</div>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">One who in subtle questions took delight</div>
<div class="i0">Came running to my lodging late one night,</div>
<div class="i0">And straight began:—“Wilt thou affirm that sin</div>
<div class="i0">Had in man’s will its root and origin,</div>
<div class="i0">When that will did itself from God proceed?</div>
<div class="i0">Whate’er then followed, he must have decreed.</div>
<div class="i0">If evil, then, be not against God’s will,</div>
<div class="i0">’Tis wrongly named, it is not truly ill.</div>
<div class="i0">Rather the world a chess-board we should name,</div>
<div class="i0">And God both sides is playing of the game:</div>
<div class="i0">Moses and Pharaoh <i>seem</i> opposed, for they</div>
<div class="i0">Do thus God’s greatness on two sides display;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
<div class="i0">They seem opposed, but at the root are one,</div>
<div class="i0">And each his part allotted has well done;</div>
<div class="i0">And that which men so blindly evil call,</div>
<div class="i0">And hate and fear and shun, is, after all,</div>
<div class="i0">Only as those discordant notes whereby</div>
<div class="i0">Well-skilled musicians heighten melody;—</div>
<div class="i0">But as the dark ground cunning painters lay,</div>
<div class="i0">To bring the bright hues into clearer day:</div>
<div class="i0">’Tis good, as yet imperfect, incomplete—</div>
<div class="i0">Fruit that is sour, while passing on to sweet.”</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Then I, who knew the world had travelled o’er</div>
<div class="i0">This line of thought a thousand times before,</div>
<div class="i0">Would all debate have willingly put by,</div>
<div class="i0">Yet with this tale at last must make reply:—</div>
<div class="i0">“The head of Seid his comrade struck one day—</div>
<div class="i0">Seid meant the blow in earnest to repay;</div>
<div class="i0">But then the striker—‘Pardon, friend, the blow—</div>
<div class="i0">I am inquiring, and two things would know:</div>
<div class="i0">See, when my hand did on your head alight,</div>
<div class="i0">Straight various bruises there appeared in sight.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
<div class="i0">Now, prithee, give me a reply to this,</div>
<div class="i0">If head or hand their ultimate cause is?</div>
<div class="i0">And if you really do with them agree</div>
<div class="i0">Who but in pain a lesser pleasure see?’</div>
<div class="i0">Seid then—‘O fool! my agony is great,</div>
<div class="i0">And think’st thou I can idly speculate?’”</div>
<div class="i0">“The same I say;—let him display his skill</div>
<div class="i0">On the world’s woe, who does not feel its ill;</div>
<div class="i0">Let speculate the man who feels no pain,</div>
<div class="i0">To whom the world is all a pageant vain—</div>
<div class="i0">An empty show, stretched out that he may sit,</div>
<div class="i0">And crying ‘Fie!’ or ‘Bravo!’ show his wit.</div>
<div class="i0">Me the deep feeling of its mighty woe</div>
<div class="i0">Robs of all wish herein my skill to show;</div>
<div class="i0">I only know that evil is no dream—</div>
<div class="i0">A thing that is, and does not merely seem:</div>
<div class="i0">Nor ask I now who open left the well,</div>
<div class="i0">Whereinto, walking carelessly, I fell;</div>
<div class="i0">Not how I stumbled in the well, but how</div>
<div class="i0">I may get out, is all my question now.”</div>

ALEXANDER AT THE GATES OF PARADISE.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>See Eisenmenger’s “Entdecktes Judenthum,” v. ii. p. 321,
with whom I trust that my readers will not agree, for he has scarcely
patience to finish this “narrische Talmudische Fabel,” as he styles
it. It reappears, slightly modified, in the Persian tradition, according
to which Alexander, having conquered the world, determined
to seek out the fountain of life. See the following note. In
like manner, in the Christian poems of the middle ages, Alexander
is made to recognise at last the vanity and emptiness of all the
glory which he has won, and is hardly turned from his purpose of
going forth at last in search of the lost Paradise. See Rosenkranz
“Gesch. d. Deutschen Poesie in Mittelalter,” p. 367. Very
notable is this making of Alexander, and no other—the man from
whom the confession comes, that the world has not that which
can truly satisfy man’s spirit, but that he still yearns for something
beyond. It is like, in the Scripture, the same confession
coming from the lips of Solomon; for in each case the experiment
has been made under the most favourable circumstances: so that
in one case, as in the other, it may be asked, “What can the
man do that cometh after the king?”</p>

CHIDHER’S WELL.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of Chidher’s Well, the Eastern λουτρον παλιγγενεσιας, Von
Hammer, in his very interesting introduction to his “History of
Persian Poetry,” gives a good account. Among other things
he says, “Cotemporary with Moses lived the Prophet Chiser, of
whom some hold that he is the same with Elias, while others
altogether distinguish them. He is one of the chief personages of
Eastern Mythology, the ever-ready helper of the oppressed, the
Genius of spring, the deliverer in peril, the admonisher of princes,
the avenger of unrighteousness, the guide through the wilderness
of the world, and, finally, the ever-youthful guardian of the fountain
of life. As such he revives the youth of men, and beasts,
and plants, gives back lost beauty, and in spring arrays the dead
earth with its fresh garments of green. His fountain bestows on
whosoever drinks it eternal beauty, youth, and wisdom. What
wonder then that all mortals with burning desire seek it, though
as yet not one, not even Alexander, the conqueror of the world,
who, in quest of it, undertook an expedition into the land of darkness,
has found it!” Probably this, his journey through the land
of darkness, is but a mythic form of his expedition through the
Libyan desert to the temple of Jupiter Ammon.</p>

<p>On this poem I may observe, that it is the first of several in
the volume written with an arrangement of rhyme hardly familiar
to the English reader, which yet is that of a great part, as I
believe, of the lyric poetry of the East, and which may not, perhaps,
be unworthy of a place among us. According to the laws
of the Ghazel,—for poems in this metre are so entitled,—the two
first lines must rhyme, and then this rhyme repeats itself in the
second line of each succeeding couplet, which is, in fact, a new
stanza, till the end of the poem,—the termination of the first line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
in each of these following couplets being left free. This single
rule of the one repeated rhyme being observed, the Ghazel admits
otherwise of the greatest possible variety; it may be composed, as
is this present, in short trochaics, in longer or shorter iambics, or,
in fact, in lines of whatsoever length or arrangement of syllables
the poet will. In Germany, the Ghazel has been perfectly
domesticated. Rückert and Count Platen are, I believe, considered
to have cultivated it with the greatest success.</p>

THE EASTERN NARCISSUS.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the attempt made by the Neo-Platonists to put a new life
into the old Grecian Mythology, Narcissus falling in love with his
own image in the water-brook was made the symbol of man casting
himself forth into the world of shows and appearances, and expecting
to find the good that would answer to his nature there, but indeed
finding nothing but disappointment and death.—The fable is
Feridoddin Attar’s, who, born in 1216, perished in the invasion
of Dschengischan at the beginning of the next century. The
account of the manner in which he was converted to the life of
contemplative piety is remarkable. He was originally a rich merchant
of spices. A pious dervisch entered his warehouse and craved
an alms. Ferid bade him to be gone. The dervisch answered,
“That can I do easily, for I possess nothing save my hood; but
thou, with so many heavy sacks, how wilt thou contrive to be gone
when the hour of thy departure has arrived?” These words made
so deep an impression on Ferid, that, from that moment, he gave
up his worldly strivings, and dedicated himself to the spiritual
life.</p>

MOSES AND JETHRO.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This story is one among the many remarkable extracts which
Tholuck, in his “Blüthensammlung aus d. Morg. Myst.,” has
given (p. 128) from the poems of the chief of the mystical writers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
of Persia, Dschelaleddin Rumi. In his treating of the subject,
however, that indifference to all positive religion, and all fixed
forms and outlines of truth, which is the very essence of the
Mystic, comes so strongly out, that I have been obliged to write
the story anew, seeking to bring out that which is really its valuable
part—that truth which a great Christian writer expressed when
he said, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sæpe amor intrat, ubi scientia foris stat.</span>”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I must acknowledge that I have only assumed from internal
evidence, that this story of the Sage gathering herbs is of Eastern
origin, owing it myself to Calderon, who introduces it in his famous
drama, “La Vida es Sueño.” The second incident of the rebuke
which the pilgrim through the desert met with for his unthankfulness
and discontent is related by Saadi in his “Rosarium,” and
he tells it as having come upon himself.</p>

LIFE THROUGH DEATH.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>See Tholuck’s “Blüthensammlung &amp;c.” p. 69. There can be no
doubt that the poet has a deeper meaning than lies on the surface:
the furnace is that of self-denial, which the natural man thinks will
be death, but which, if he dares to prove, he finds to be life. Being
willing to lose his life, he finds it.</p>

<p>In relation to v. 12, it may be needful to observe, that the
Mahomedans believe it was in the breath of Christ that the
healing virtue lay, by which his miraculous cures were effected.
It is a tradition alike Jewish and Mahomedan, that Abraham was
flung into the furnace by Nimrod, for refusing to worship his
false gods; whereupon the flames, instead of scorching and consuming,
were turned for him into a bed of jasmine and roses.</p>

and the woman that was a sinner, and all the deep relations of law
and grace; and a reference to the original, or at least <i>my</i> original,

<p>The doctrine of evil as not indeed evil, but only an inferior

wrought out with great skill and frequency by the Eastern Mystics—often
comes out in their writings in its most offensive shapes.
It is curious to notice how completely they have anticipated this
view, which continually reappears in the philosophical systems of
our own day, and is in them brought forward as some mighty discovery,
as a key to all the perplexities of the actual world. See
Tholuck’s “Saufismus,” p. 255, seq., and “Blüthensammlung

<h2>NOTE.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>The subject of the following Poem was first suggested to me by
Calderon’s noble drama, “El Principe Constante,” accessible not
only to the Spanish, but, through Schlegel’s admirable translation,
to the German scholar also: from it also I have derived the
name. I am, however, much more indebted to a Life of the
Prince, published at Berlin, 1827, which gives many original
documents connected with the unfortunate expedition to Africa,
and actual details of the captivity, and sufferings, and death of the
Prince;—a little volume which strikingly exemplifies how far
richer and deeper will oftentimes be the simple truth than any
fiction, since all that even so great a poet as Calderon has imagined
for the casting a glory round his Christian hero is weak and
poor compared with the simple reality;—which, however, I may
add, I have not so strictly followed but that I have felt myself at
liberty to alter and modify the details as best suited my purpose.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to the English reader to know how much
of English blood was in the veins of the Prince:—his mother,
Philippa, who married John the First of Portugal, was sister to
our fourth Henry.</p>

<p>This poem was first suggested by some words in the “Sirenes,
sive Voluptas,” in Lord Bacon’s “Sapientia Veterum.” [Orpheus]
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">laudes Deorum cantans et reboans, Sirenum voces confudit
et summovit: meditationes enim rerum divinarum voluptates
sensûs non tantum potestate, sed etiam suavitate superant.”
According to the author of the “Orphic Argonautics,” the song
of Orpheus ended the enchantment of the Sirens, and caused
them to fling themselves into the sea, where they were changed
into rocks. Lord Bacon gives finely the meaning of the shore
white with bones (stanza xix.), which yet were unable to deter
others from approaching;—how it teaches us “exempla calamitatum,
licet clara et conspicua, contra voluptatum corruptelas non
multum proficere</span>.”</p>

<p>The classical reader will at once recognise, in more than one
passage, my obligations to Pindar.</p>

THE OIL OF MERCY.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The traditions concerning the relations between the Tree of
life which was set in Paradise, and the Cross on which hung
the Saviour of the world, are almost infinite; or, rather, the one
deep idea of their identity has clothed itself in innumerable forms.
They constitute indeed one of the richest portions of what may
without offence be termed the Mythology of the Christian Church.
That which I have followed here is given in the “Evangelium
Nicodemi,” c. 19. See Thilo’s “Codex Apocryphus,” v. i. p. 684.
In the “Recognitions” of Clement, l. 1, c. 45, an Ebionite book,
and therefore only acknowledging the humanity of Christ, he is,
consistently with this view, said, not himself to anoint, but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
have been anointed with the oil from the Tree of Life. The
connexion between the Tree of Life and the Cross of Christ has
been twice wrought up into sublime dramatic poems by Calderon;
once in his Auto, entitled “El Arbor del mejor Fruto;” and
again in that which is indeed only the same poem in a later and
more perfect form, “La Sibila del Oriente.” We have the same
tradition of Seth going to the gates of Paradise in the fine old
Cornish Mystery of “The Creation of the World,” which was
lately published with an English translation; and allusions to it
are frequent in all the popular literature of the Middle Ages;
see, for instance, Göthe’s recension of the “Reineke Fuchs,”
near the beginning of the tenth book; and I remember a curious
passage about it in Mandeville’s “Travels.” Rückert, in the
following poem, has given the tradition in somewhat a different
shape.</p>

<p>I may just observe that this poem is an attempt—I will confess
a most unsuccessful one—to write English verse in the Spanish
assonant rhyme, of which the principle is, that words are considered
to rhyme which have the same vowel-sounds, though the
consonants are different: thus, <i>angel</i> and <i>raiment</i> having the
same vowel-sounds, <i>a—e</i>, are perfect assonant rhymes. As in
the Persian Ghazel, there is but one rhyme running through the
whole poem, and in this all the alternate lines, beginning with
the second, terminate: and of course the rhythmical effect of the
poem is to be judged, not by any half-dozen lines apart, but by
the total impression which the whole Poem continuously read
leaves on the ear.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
